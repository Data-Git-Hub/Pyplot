    "### Introduction\n",
    "This project demonstrates foundational data visualization techniques using Python’s Matplotlib library, specifically the pyplot module. Through a series of guided tasks, I create and compare different types of visual charts—including scatter plots and line plots—by generating random data points with Python's random module or NumPy. These visualizations help reinforce core concepts in chart construction, data presentation, and the customization options available in Matplotlib. The project is executed in a Jupyter Notebook environment, using clean code and Markdown headings to document each step and response. The goal is to build both technical fluency in Matplotlib and an understanding of how to effectively present data in a visual format that is clear, accurate, and engaging. <br>\n",

    "### Imports\n",
    "Python libraries are collections of pre-written code that provide specific functionalities, making programming more efficient and reducing the need to write code from scratch. These libraries cover a wide range of applications, including data analysis, machine learning, web development, and automation. Some libraries, such as os, sys, math, json, and datetime, come built-in with Python as part of its standard library, providing essential functions for file handling, system operations, mathematical computations, and data serialization. Other popular third-party libraries, like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn, must be installed separately and are widely used in data science and machine learning. The extensive availability of libraries in Python's ecosystem makes it a versatile and powerful programming language for various domains. <br>\n",

    "Matplotlib is a widely used data visualization library that allows users to create static, animated, and interactive plots. It provides extensive tools for generating various chart types, including line plots, scatter plots, histograms, and bar charts, making it a critical library for exploratory data analysis. <br>\n",

    "### Tasks\n",
    "Perform the tasks described in the Markdown cells below.  When you have completed the assignment make sure your code cells have all been run (and have output beneath them) and ensure you have committed and pushed ALL of your changes to your assignment repository. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Every question that requires you to write code will have a code cell underneath it; you may either write your entire solution in that cell or write it in a python file (`.py`), then import and run the appropriate code to answer the question. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not use other external modules except `matplotlib` and `pyplot` (e.g. `math`, etc) for this assignment unless you are explicitly instructed to, though you may use built in python functions (`min`, `max`, etc) as you wish. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "For all of these questions, your plots must have an appropriate title and labeled axes.  Use the Matplotlib documentation as necessary to guide you through these exercises. <br>"

    "TEXT = \"At three o’clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o’clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be. I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.\".lower()\n",
